# CS-230

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted to create a web application game of their android application game, Draw It or Lose It. The game has to render an image at a fixed rate, allow the guessing team 30-seconds to guess as the image renders, and then give the opposing team(s) an opportunity  for 15 seconds if the guessing team doesn't solve the puzzle. Draw It or Lose It has to work on multiple platforms, have only one instance of the game exist in memory, allow one or more teams to play, have each team have multiple players, and ensure that game and team names are unique.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did a good job on the executive summary. I summarized the requirements for the project in a concise manner. I also feel like a laid out the design contraints well.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document helped me understand the requirments, limitations, and expected complications. Also, the UML class diagram helped me understand the structure of the program which made it easier to implement the structure.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the evaluation table. I would go into more detial about the different tools. I do think what I wrote for development tools is relavent, but there is probably more I could have added. I would also revise storage and memory managment in recommendations. I feel like I could have done a better job at connecting how storage and memory works in relation to the project itself.


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I thought about the user expirience and how the game should be expirienced and played based off the clients requirments. It is important to consider the user's needs because the user is who the product is for. If the users needs aren't met, it only matters so much that you met the clients set requirments because the user will not want to use the product if it is difficult for them to use.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the softeware by forming solutions around the requirments and design constraints. In the future, I would make sure to write out the requirments and design contraints, like done for these projects, and also evaluate the different options I have available as we did regaurding the different operating systems.
